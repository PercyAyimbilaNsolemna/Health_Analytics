# Hospital Analytics Data Warehouse (OLTP → OLAP)

## Project Overview

This project designs and implements a **hospital analytics data warehouse** using a **Star Schema** to support fast, reliable, and scalable OLAP queries.

The work demonstrates the full data warehousing lifecycle:

- Starting from a normalized OLTP schema
- Designing dimensions, fact tables, and bridge tables
- Implementing ETL logic
- Optimizing analytical queries
- Evaluating performance improvements using execution plans

**Goal:** Demonstrate why and how star schemas outperform normalized schemas for analytical workloads.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Source System (OLTP)

The OLTP schema models real hospital operations, including:

- Patients
- Providers
- Encounters
- Diagnoses
- Procedures
- Billing

This schema is **highly normalized** and optimized for transactions (INSERT/UPDATE).

### Target System (OLAP)

The OLAP schema reorganizes data into a **Star Schema** optimized for analytics:

- One central fact table
- Multiple dimension tables
- Bridge tables for many-to-many relationships

---

## Star Schema Design

### Fact Table

**`fact_encounter`**

- **Grain:** One row per encounter
- **Stores:**
  - Surrogate keys to all dimensions
  - Pre-aggregated metrics
  - Flags used for analytics

**Key metrics include:**

- `total_allowed_amount`
- `diagnosis_count`
- `procedure_count`
- `is_readmission`

### Dimension Tables

| Dimension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `dim_patient` | Patient demographics |
| `dim_provider` | Provider details |
| `dim_specialty` | Medical specialties |
| `dim_department` | Hospital departments |
| `dim_date` | Calendar attributes |
| `dim_encounter_type` | Encounter classification |
| `dim_diagnosis` | ICD-10 diagnosis details |
| `dim_procedure` | CPT procedure details |

All dimensions use **surrogate keys** to ensure:

- Stable joins
- Faster query performance
- Independence from OLTP key changes

### Bridge Tables

| Bridge Table | Relationship |
|--------------|--------------|
| `bridge_encounter_diagnoses` | Encounter ↔ Diagnosis |
| `bridge_encounter_procedures` | Encounter ↔ Procedure |

Bridge tables handle true **many-to-many relationships** without exploding the fact table.

## ETL Process

### ETL Strategy

The ETL process moves data from OLTP to OLAP in four stages:

1. **Extract**
   - Pull data from OLTP tables

2. **Transform**
   - Clean data
   - Deduplicate
   - Derive metrics

3. **Load Dimensions**
   - Generate surrogate keys
   - Load descriptive attributes

4. **Load Facts & Bridges**
   - Lookup dimension keys
   - Store pre-aggregated metrics

### Load Order (Critical)

1. `dim_date`
2. `dim_specialty`
3. `dim_department`
4. `dim_encounter_type`
5. `dim_provider`
6. `dim_patient`
7. `dim_diagnosis`
8. `dim_procedure`
9. `fact_encounter`
10. Bridge tables

## Analytical Queries (OLAP)

The star schema supports common healthcare analytics such as:

- Monthly encounters by specialty and encounter type
- Most common diagnosis–procedure combinations
- Readmission rates by specialty
- Revenue trends over time

Queries are:

- Short
- Easy to read
- Fast to execute
- Free of complex business logic

---

## Performance Improvements

| Query | OLTP Time | OLAP Time | Improvement |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Diagnosis–Procedure Analysis | 0.18 ms | 0.04 ms | **4.5× faster** |
| Revenue by Specialty | 0.25 ms | 0.06 ms | **4.2× faster** |

### Why the Speedup?

- Fewer joins
- No join explosion
- Pre-computed metrics
- No `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)`
- Dimensional date handling
